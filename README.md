# Hotel_Management_System

Features in Action
Advanced OOPs Concepts: The system's codebase is organized using inheritance and polymorphism. This helps the developers maintain and expand the system without creating redundant code.

Data Hiding Mechanism: Sensitive customer information, such as credit card details, is securely encapsulated within appropriate classes. This ensures that only authorized methods can access and modify this data, enhancing customer privacy.

Reservation Module: Hotel staff can easily make reservations for customers through the system's user-friendly interface. Let's walk through an example of making a reservation:

A staff member logs into the system using their credentials.
They navigate to the reservation module and select the desired check-in and check-out dates, room type, and number of guests.
The system displays the available rooms and their details, helping the staff member choose the most suitable room.
After confirming the reservation details, the system generates a unique reservation ID and stores the information securely.
If the customer wants to modify the reservation, the staff can easily access and modify the reservation details using authorized methods.
In case of a cancellation request, the staff can locate the reservation and initiate the cancellation process while adhering to the hotel's cancellation policy.
